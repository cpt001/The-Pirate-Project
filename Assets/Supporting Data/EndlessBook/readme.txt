Thank you for choosing EndlessBook

EndlessBook is a complete way to visualize a book inside your Unity scene.

EndlessBook is more than just an animated mesh. It comes complete with scripts to handle updating your pages, animating the book states and page turns, swapping out static models when not animating, and firing handlers when the book changes state or starts / stops a page turn.

â€‹Make your pages come alive with custom shaders and render textures. Offer an interactive experience to your users that sets your project apart!
