/// Idea:
/// So, this is implementation 1 of the island controller.
/// Each structure requires a certain set of items to produce items for its own inventory. 
/// The structure makes a request to the island controller, seeking the item as needed.
/// If the item is unavailable, and not in production/being made, then it sends a request to any nearby aligned islands.
/// If the item is unavailable at nearby aligned islands, it sends a request to a neighboring nation that is friendly.
/// If the call is answered negatively, the controller will look through the game manifest, to see if it's available on any island.
/// If not, the resource is requested from off-map *the host countries continent*, at an exorbetant price
